# hello-world
kiddie repository to use until i learn proper organization
i'm trying to do something in the world.  nothing i've tried so far has really worked for me, but i've got this idea that i think it would be really cool if i could realize it.  i've been flailing about uselessly for 29 years because i can't focus on anything hard enough.  but this idea i have is a really good one.  we'll see.
